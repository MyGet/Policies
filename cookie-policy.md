# MyGet Cookie Policy

This document was last updated on: May 22, 2018

The MyGet [Privacy Policy](https://www.myget.org/policies/privacy) explains MyGet's principles when it comes to the collection, processing, and storage of your information. This Cookie Policy specifically explains how MyGet, and its Partners, deploy cookies, as well as the options you have to control them.

## What are cookies?

Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to ‘remember’ you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a ’session cookie’) or for multiple repeat visits (using a ‘persistent cookie’). They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and remain logged in. Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as ‘first party cookies’), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website (‘third party cookies’).

Both websites and HTML e-mails may also contain other tracking technologies such as ‘web beacons’, or ‘pixels’. These are typically small transparent images that provide us with statistics, for similar purposes as cookies. They are often used in conjunction with cookies, though they are not stored on your computer in the same way. As a result, if you disable cookies, the web beacons may still load, but their functionality will be restricted. 

## How we use cookies

We use cookies for a number of different purposes. Some cookies are necessary for technical reasons, and some enable a personalized experience for both visitors and registered users. Some of these cookies may be set when a page is loaded, or when a visitor takes a particular action.

Many of the cookies we use are only set if you are a registered MyGet user (so you don’t have to log in every time, for example), while others are set whenever you visit one of our websites, irrespective of whether you have an account.

For more information on the choices you have about the cookies we use, please see the "Controlling Cookies" section below.

## Where we place cookies

We set cookies on our websites (including myget.org, blog.myget.org, and docs.myget.org).

## Types of Cookie

The table below explains the types of cookies we use on our websites, and why we use them.

|---|---|
| Strictly Necessary | These cookies are essential for websites on our services to perform their basic functions. These include those required to allow registered users to authenticate and perform account related functions. |
| Functionality | These cookies are used to store preferences set by users such as account name or language preference. |
| Security | We use these cookies to help identify and prevent potential security risks. |

## Controlling Cookies

Visitors may wish to restrict the use of cookies, or completely prevent them from being set. Most browsers provide for ways to control cookie behavior such as the length of time they are stored – either through built-in functionality or by utilizing third party plugins. If you disable cookies, please be aware that some of the features of our service may not function correctly.
