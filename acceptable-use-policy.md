# MyGet Acceptable Use Policy

MyGet has adopted a philosophy that assumes the honesty and good intent of our Subscribers, therefore  our services are provided in as unrestricted a manner as possible to allow our users to have the richest Service experience possible.

This Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") must be read in conjunction with our applicable [Terms of Service](https://www.myget.org/policies/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.myget.org/policies/privacy), and may be subject to change from time to time.

It is the Subscriber’s responsibility to ensure that they comply with the latest edition of the AUP at any given time. The latest version of this document can be found on the MyGet Site.

This Acceptable Use Policy may be revised, without notice, at any time, at the sole discretion of MyGet. Completion of the relevant application form, or connection to the Service for the first time, is deemed to be an agreement to our Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policies.
